                                                         Introduction
                                                      



## **Background**: 
A bike share company located in Chicago, Illinois. The bike-share program features more than 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The company also offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike.

The company's marketing strategy relies on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The financial team has concluded that annual members are more profitable compared to casual riders. The director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth. Instead of creating a marketing campaign to target all new customers, the director thinks there is an opportunity to convert casual riders into annual members.




## **ROLE**: 
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently. Then, we will use these insights to come up with marketing strategies to help with our business task.



## **Goal**: 
The overall goal is to design a new marketing strategy targeting factors extracted from data insights aimed to convert casual riders into annual members.


## **Business Task**: 
How do annual members and casual riders use bikes differently?


## **PREPARE**:
The dataset can be found here https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. The dataset is public and made available by Motivate International Inc. under the Divvy Bikes License. 

The data contains trips about the number of trips taken per month in a year, by a casual rider or an annual member, the times and dates, etc. Analyzing this information to get a breakdown of the differences between casual riders and member riders will help provide us solid information on answering our question of how the use of bikes differ between both types of consumers. 



## **PROCESS**:
I started the data cleaning process in Excel, but quickly found that the files were far too big for Excel, and very large for SQL. I opted to use R, and while RStudio Cloud could not upload the data I found that RStudio Desktop was able to seamlessly. My choice to utilize R came from seeing that the data had over 5 million points of data to work with, and to be able to create an R Markdown worksheet to better map out my process of data cleaning with code step by step. 



The visualization and presentation was done on Tableau and can be viewed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/visan2980/viz/DataAnalyticsProjectDashboard/Story1#1)
