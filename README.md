# Data-Analytics-Project


                                                         Introduction
                                                         

This is one of the case study projects from the Google Data Analytics certificate. I will be answering the guideline questions and dive into the data to provide visualizations, analysis, and a solution to the posed question.



## **SCENARIO**: Cyclistic is a bike share company located in Chicago. The bike-share program feature more than 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. They set themselves apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth. Instead of creating a marketing campaign to target all new customers, the director thinks there is a very good chance to convert casual riders to members.




## **ROLE**: I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. My team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Then, we will use these insights to come up with marketing strategies to help with our business task.



## **Goal**: The overall goal of this project is to design a new marketing strategy from our data insights aimed to convert casual riders into annual members.
Business Task: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?




## **PREPARE**:
The dataset can be found here https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. The dataset is public and made available by Motivate International Inc. under the Divvy Bikes License. Credit card numbers are not made available for privacy and security concerns. For the sake of this project, the data is considered credible to use. 

The data contains trips about the number of trips taken per month in a year, by a casual or member rider, the times and dates, etc. Organizing this information to get a breakdown of the differences between casual riders and member riders will help provide us solid information on answering our question of how the use of Cyclistic bikes differ between both types of consumers. 



## **PROCESS**:
I started the data cleaning process in Excel, but quickly found that the files were far too big for Excel, and very large for SQL. I opted to use R, and while RStudio Cloud could not upload the data I found that RStudio Desktop was able to seamlessly. My choice to utilize R came from seeing that the data had over 5 million points of data to work with, and to be able to create an R Markdown worksheet to better map out my process of data cleaning with code step by step. 



The visualization and presentation was done on Tableau and can be viewed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/visan2980/viz/DataAnalyticsProjectDashboard/Story1#1)
